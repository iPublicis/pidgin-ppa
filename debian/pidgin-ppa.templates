Description: Unsupported distribution
 The pidgin-ppa package only supports Ubuntu.

 You should either contact ${DISTRIB_ID} support about newer versions of
 Pidgin or compile Pidgin from source.
 .
 If ${DISTRIB_ID} is binary compatible with Ubuntu, please use the
 support@pidgin.im mailing list to help develop a mapping table between
 ${DISTRIB_ID} releases and the underlying Ubuntu releases.
